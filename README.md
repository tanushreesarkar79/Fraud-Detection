# Fraudulent Behavior Detection in Online Networks
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent behavior in online networks using network activity analysis and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify users as either legitimate or suspicious based on their interactions within the network.

# Project Overview
Fraudulent activities in online platforms can be identified by analyzing user behaviors such as the number of friends and message frequency. This project uses K-Means clustering to segment users and detect suspicious patterns that may indicate fraud.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and standardize the dataset for machine learning.
K-Means Clustering: Apply the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and segment users into fraudulent and legitimate groups.
Fraud Detection: Identify fraudulent users based on specific patterns (e.g., low number of friends, high message count).
Visualizations: Display the clustering results and suspicious user distributions with pair plots and Elbow graphs.

# How It Works
Dataset Preparation: Load the dataset, clean unnecessary columns, and standardize the features.
Clustering: Use the K-Means algorithm to classify users based on network activity.
Cluster Analysis: Analyze cluster centers to identify suspicious behaviors and flag potentially fraudulent users.
Visualization: Visualize the clustering process and the classification of users using graphs and charts.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For K-Means clustering and data preprocessing.
Seaborn/Matplotlib: For data visualization.

# How to Run the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Upload your dataset (e.g., data7.csv).
Run the notebook to:
Preprocess the data.
Perform clustering using K-Means.
Visualize results.
Identify potentially fraudulent users.
Download the results as a CSV file.

# Results
The project identifies clusters of potentially fraudulent users based on their activity in the online network, providing valuable insights for preventing fraudulent behavior.
