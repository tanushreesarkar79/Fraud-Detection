# Fraudulent Behavior Detection in Online Networks

This project aims to detect fraudulent users in online networks by analyzing network properties and applying anomaly detection techniques.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized the dataset for optimal machine learning performance.
K-Means Clustering: Used K-Means clustering to classify users based on their activity. The Elbow Method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (2 clusters).
Suspicious Activity Detection: Defined suspicious patterns (low friend count, high message frequency) to identify potentially fraudulent users.
Visualizations: Used pair plots and Elbow graphs to visualize user activity and clustering results.
Results:
Detected clusters of potentially fraudulent users based on their network behavior, helping to identify suspicious activities in online networks.
